# Description

###### [Back to Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)
The purpose of this group project was to develop a MERN application that showcases the skills that we have developed throughout the bootcamp. Specifically skills surrounding MongoDB, REACT, JWT, and GraphQl. The following is the elevator pitch: Are you tired of scrolling through endless pages of search results to find the perfect image? Look no further than Artbot AI! Our AI-powered image generator allows you to search for anything and generates unique, high-quality images for you to use. Plus, with our secure login and signup feature, you can rest assured that your information and images are safe. And the best part? You can save your favorite images to use again and again. Say goodbye to boring, generic images and hello to ArtBot AI!
